"Condition","Measure Code","Measure Name","Score"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_8","Outpatients with low back pain who had an MRI without trying recommended treatments first, such as physical therapy. (If a number is high, it may mean the facility is doing too many unnecessary MRIs for low back pain.) Lower percentages are better","36.5"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_9","Outpatients who had a follow-up mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI of the breast within 45 days after a screening mammogram. (A follow-up rate near zero may indicate missed cancer; a rate higher than 14% may mean there is unnecessary follow up.)","8.8"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_10","Outpatient CT scans of the abdomen that were “combination” (double) scans. (If a number is high, it may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.) Lower percentages are better","12.7"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_11","Outpatient CT scans of the chest that were “combination” (double) scans. (If a number is high, it may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.) Lower percentages are better","3.7"
