"Condition","Measure Code","Measure Name","Score"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_8","Outpatients with low back pain who had an MRI without trying recommended treatments first, such as physical therapy. (If a number is high, it may mean the facility is doing too many unnecessary MRIs for low back pain.)<br/><i><b>Lower</b> percentages are better</i>","36.8"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_9","Outpatients who had a follow-up mammogram or ultrasound within 45 days after a screening mammogram. (A number that is much lower than 8% may mean there’s not enough follow-up. A number much higher than 14% may mean there’s too much unnecessary follow-up.)<br/><i>Percentages <b>between 8 percent and 14 percent</b> are better</i>","8.5"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_10","Outpatient CT scans of the abdomen that were “combination” (double) scans. (The range for this measure is 0 to 1. A number very close to 1 may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.)<br/><i>Numbers <b>closer to zero</b> are better</i>","0.149"
"Use of Medical Imaging","OP_11","Outpatient CT scans of the chest that were “combination” (double) scans. (The range for this measure is 0 to 1. A number very close to 1 may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.)<br/><i>Numbers <b>closer to zero</b> are better</i>","0.044"
