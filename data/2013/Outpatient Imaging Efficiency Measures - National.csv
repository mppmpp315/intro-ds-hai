"Outpatient CT scans of the abdomen that were “combination” (double) scans. (If a number is high, it may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.) Lower percentages are better","12.7"
"Outpatients with brain CT scans who got a sinus CT scan at the same time. Lower percentages are better","2.8"
"Outpatient CT scans of the chest that were “combination” (double) scans. (If a number is high, it may mean that too many patients are being given a double scan when a single scan is all they need.) Lower percentages are better","3.7"
"Outpatients with low back pain who had an MRI without trying recommended treatments first, such as physical therapy. (If a number is high, it may mean the facility is doing too many unnecessary MRIs for low back pain.) Lower percentages are better","36.5"
"Outpatients who got cardiac imaging stress tests before low-risk outpatient surgery. Lower percentages are better","5.5"
"Outpatients who had a follow-up mammogram, ultrasound, or MRI of the breast within 45 days after a screening mammogram. (A follow-up rate near zero may indicate missed cancer; a rate higher than 14% may mean there is unnecessary follow up.)","8.8"
